# ECG-Classification-using-ML
Adaptive filter weights, mean, and variance of ECG signals are used as features.
Logistic Regression, k-nearest neighbors(KNN), and AdaBoost classifiers predict the given ECG signal either as normal or abnormal (normal represented with '1' and
abnormal represented with '0')
Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are applied to visualize the two classes (0 or 1) of the dataset in a two-dimensional map. 
Metrics accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to identify the best algorithm for long-term and short-term signals. 
The PDF report has details of the classification experiment.

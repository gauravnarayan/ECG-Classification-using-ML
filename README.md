# ECG-Classification-using-ML
In this report Adaptive filter weights, mean, and variance of ECG signals are used as features.
Logistic Regression, k-nearest neighbors(KNN) and AdaBoost classifiers are used to to predict the correct label, normal or abnormal, of given ECG signals.
Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are applied to visualizethe two classes of data in two-dimensional map. 
Metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score are used to identify the best algorithm for long term and short term signals. 
The PDF report has details of the experiment.
